# Test and validations
## Introduction
During the development process, unit testing has been done to check if functionality is as expected. Same test has been executed again later on when new features has been added. This you can see as a type of regression testing. 

Exploratory testing has been done. If a bug was found in one function same test has been executed on a similar or related function to find out if same bug can be found. For example, when bug “User can add a username that is empty or contains only spaces” was found the same test was done to the function that lets the user write in budget name. This led to the same bug being found. This you can see as a type of error guessing. 

All performed test hasn’t been documented because the extensive documentation that would require. 
## Test
Some tests aren’t attached to a requirement. All requirements can’t be specified, some functions of a system can be seen as obvious. 
### Test cases
### Other tests
#### Test id: 6 Test name: Menu testing
All menus have been tested by selecting first and last valid menu option. The first invalid menu option has always been tested by that I mean if the first menu option is one, zero has also been tested. If last menu option is four, five also has been tested.

#### Test id: 7 Test name: Error messages usability testing 
All error messages usability has been tested. Which mean that the user when doing wrong is shown a message containing error description and information of what to do next. 

#### Test id:  8 Test name: Error provoking testing
Testing trying to provoke errors has been done. For example, entering empty strings or blank spaces in different input scenarios and entering very large numbers when creating a budget or budget entries. 

#### Test id: 9 Test name: Usability testing
In this test one independent user has been presented with some tasks to do in the budget system. Through testing the person has been observed to see if any usability improvements can be found. 
The user was tasked to perform the following:
1.	Create a user.
2.	Create a budget.
3.	Add several different purchases to the budget you have created.
4.	Get a summary of your created budget.
5.	End your budget.
