# Budget System
## Introduction
Budget system is an aid for financially conscious private individuals who wants to be able to set a budget and then follow how much they spend on shopping, food, entertainment, and other things. In this program the user can create one or several budgets, add a purchase to chosen budget, get a summary of chosen budget and end chosen budget.

## UX/Design 
### Text colour
This system contains five different colours. The colours contribute to make it more obvious for the user because they are following a certain pattern.  
- Welcome message and text that confirms user choice for example created budget or ended budget have the colour of green. 
- All menu options have the colour of blue. 
- When the user is asked to choose a menu option the text have the colour of white.
- If the user is asked to write in something else than a menu option the text have the colour of pink. 
- All text that confirms for example active user and ask the user what they want to do next have the colour of yellow.
- All error messages have the colour of red.

### Emojis
-	To make the system feel fun and more alive it contains these three emojis: üí∞üí∂üôÇ
## Requirements 
### User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a user account so that I can use the budget system.
- As a user, I want to see the budgets connected to my user account so that I can chose budget. 
- As a user, I want to create a new budget so I can track my budget goal.
- As a user, I want to have multiple budgets so that I can have different budgets goals.
- As a user, I want to add purchase to my budget so that my purchase is saved.
- As a user, I want to purchase to different budgets so that my purchase is saved in chosen budget.
- As a user, I want to get a summary of my budget progress whenever I want so that I can follow my spendings.
- As a user, I want to end chosen budget whenever I want so that the budget is not active because I am done.

## Features
### Select user
-	The first step in the system is that the user needs to confirm if they are a recurring user or a new user. This step is crucial for the usage of the system. By doing this the user only gets the data related to the specific user.

<img src="readme_images/welcome_menu.PNG">

### Create user
-	In this menu option the user will be able to create a new user by adding their information: first name, last name and username. A confirmation is shown if the user has been created. 

<img src="readme_images/create_user.PNG">

### Create budget
-	In this menu option the user will be able to create a budget by choosing a budget name and add spendings for each category. The user will be given a confirmation of chosen budget name and be presented with a summary of chosen budget spendings.

<img src="readme_images/create_budget.PNG">

### Budget entry
-	In this menu option the user will be able to choose and add a purchase to chosen budget. After added purchase the user will be presented with a text that confirms that the purchase has been added. 

<img src="readme_images/budget_entry.PNG">

### Budget summary
-	In this menu option the user will be able to choose a budget to get a summary of. So that they can see how much they have spent so far and how much that is left to spend.  The user will get a confirmation, in this case which budget they have chosen to get a summary of. 

<img src="readme_images/budget_summary.PNG">

### End budget
-	In this menu option the user will be able to end an ongoing budget (change it from active to inactive). This is to make it more clear for the user which budget that no longer is ongoing.  
-	The user can‚Äôt add a purchase to an ended budget, but they still can get a summary of the budget. This is because they may want to go back and compare one budget with another.

<img src="readme_images/end_budget.PNG">

### Common features
-	Depending on how many budgets the user has, the menu when the user choose budget is flexible and all budgets will be given a menu number. This applies to all occasions where the user will be presented with their personal budgets.  This way of selecting budgets was chosen to give the user a consistent way of navigating the system, because all menu selections are done by numbers.
 
-	When the user is asked to choose a menu option the system always show the user which options they can choose between. This is to prevent the user writing wrong input and making the system easy to use. 
### Error handling
-	This system will give the user different error messages depending on what went wrong. This is to try to lead the user in the right direction so the next input will be correct.  
-	Menu options. If the user writes a letter, other character, a number the menu doesn‚Äôt contain, only whitespaces, or nothing at all. The user will be displayed a message. 

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_1.PNG">

-	The user will have the same error messages as above except the message for menu options when entering budget spendings or purchases in their budget. The message for when entering letters has also been more adapted. 

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_2.PNG">

-	In contrast to menu option, when entering first name and last name the user will get an error message if entering numbers, other characters, only whitespaces, or nothing at all. The user will be displayed with a message that tells the user that the name only can contain letters. 

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_3.PNG">

Username and budget name allows both numbers and letters but don‚Äôt allow only whitespaces or nothing at all.  The user will be displayed with a message that tells the user that the username/budget name can‚Äôt not be empty or only contain spaces.

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_4.PNG">

-	If the user chooses a username that already exists, the user will be asked to choose another one.

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_5.PNG">

-	If the user tries to add a purchase but don‚Äôt have any ongoing budget (active) they will be presented with an error message.

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_6.PNG">

-	If the user tries to end a budget that is already ended, they will be presented with an error message.

<img src="readme_images/error_handling_7.PNG">

## Data
All information about the user and the budgets is stored in a Google Sheet document. 
### Structure
-	The Google Sheet document contains the three worksheets: budgets, budgets entries and users. Each worksheet contains different columns but there is one column that you can find in all three sheets and that is the user id (in the user file it‚Äôs called only id). The user id is the key that connects the worksheets, so the user can be paired to right budget and entry.

<img src="readme_images/worksheet_users.PNG">

-	The worksheets for budgets and budget entries have another category in comment and that is budget id. The budget id connects the worksheets, so the entry can be paired to right budget. 

<img src="readme_images/worksheet_budgets.PNG">

-	Budget entries worksheet also has a column for id, this is not used to connect any row to any other worksheet.

## Bugs corrections and improvements 
### Unfixed bugs
-	There are no known bugs. 
### Solved bugs
-	System crash when user creates a new user then goes directly to option ‚ÄúCreate a new budget‚Äù. When user data came from input the data type of active_user was different compared to when data was read from worksheet. Solved by changing data type of active_user. 
-	System crash when user choose option ‚ÄúDone‚Äù before adding a purchase. Solved by add if-statement that checks if variable add_more is true, so saving to worksheet is only done when add_more is true (only false when selecting ‚ÄúDone‚Äù)
-	User can choose option two to four without having created a budget (has no budget). If there isn‚Äôt a budget the user shouldn‚Äôt be able to use those options. Solved by adding function check_if_user_has_budget which check if user has any budgets.
-	User can create a username that already exists. Solved by adding loop around username input. If list contains chosen username user will get error message and be asked to choose another username. 
-	System crash when choosing a menu option in budget entries that doesn‚Äôt exist (and isn't zero). As a result of the crash the system saves a purchase to the sheet that hasn‚Äôt been added by the user. Solved by declaring variables "budget_category" and "budget_entry" and adding budget_category to if statement.
### Future improvements

System:
-	Add password to ensure that no one else can see their budgets.
-	Give the user the option to compare different budgets.
-	Give the user the option to choose if they want to see all budgets or only active budgets.
-	Present the user with more information in the budget summary for example how much in percentage that is spent.

Code:
- Add type hinting
- Put python files in a folder
- Make some part of the code shorter
