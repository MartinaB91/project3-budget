# Budget System
## Introduction
Budget system is an aid for financially conscious private individuals who wants to be able to set a budget and then follow how much they spend on shopping, food, entertainment, and other things. In this program the user can create one or several budgets, add a purchase to chosen budget, get a summary of chosen budget and end chosen budget. 
## UX/Design 
### Text color
This system contains five different colours. The colours contribute to make it more obvious for the user because they are following a certain pattern.  
- Welcome message and text that confirms user choice for example created budget or ended budget have the colour of green. 
- All menu options have the colour of blue. 
- When the user is asked to choose a menu option the text have the colour of white.
- If the user is asked to write in something else than a menu option the text have the colour of pink. 
- All text that confirms for example active user and ask the user what they want to do next have the colour of purple.
- All error messages have the colour of red.
